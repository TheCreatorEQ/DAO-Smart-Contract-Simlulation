# DAO-Smart-Contract-Simlulation

The following program uses the SUMO traffic simulation environment.

The following simulation is to show the proof-of-concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) 
in traffic data recording and consensus within 2 different traffic networks. 
A simplistic and complex network model are used to test the ability of real-time DAO formation and data validation.  

The file of ledger.csv will record all DAO contract activities. 

Within main.py, file path can be changed to commerce.sumocfg or grid.sumocfg. 

Grid provides a simulation of car behaviour at intersection points. 
Commerce provides a more complex network and thus vehicle behaviour.
